# Unity FFXVI Combat System

This project is a recreation of Final Fantasy XVI's combat system in Unity. It uses Unity's High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) to achieve graphical fidelity, and showcases many of the features present in the original game. Although this is primarily a recreation, the main idea was ensuring a fluid, visually appealing third-person combat experience. Developers and enthusiasts are encouraged to utilize this as a reference, learning resource, or foundation for further development.

## Features
* Combo system. The player has a queue of attacks to be executed in order, and each one can be configured independently.
* Freeflow combat. The player can smoothly transition from one enemy to another.
* Enemy AI with FSM. The enemies can orbit the player, approach, chase, retreat, and attack.
* Phoenix Shift. One of Final Fantasy XVI's main skills that allows the player to teleport towards an enemy in a fire strike.
* Precision dodge. The player can dodge attacks, and if they were almost hit, the precision dodge is triggered.
* Precision counter. If the player attacks right after a precision dodge, it triggers a precision counter attack.
* Eikonic abilities. A modular ability system that supports camera movements, animations, VFX, and several different settings.
