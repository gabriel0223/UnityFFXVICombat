In this view you can see how to use [Shader_Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@12.1/manual/Getting-Started.html) to help control the way details blend into the terrain. In this scene the detail draw distance is set to approximately 150 meters. Ordinarily you would see patches of details appear or disappear when they reach the maximum draw distance.

In this scene, we used a Shader Graph shader that gradually multiplies a screen dither pattern into the transparency of the details.  This helps the details to fade out gradually rather than simply disappearing abruptly as they cross the boundary. We also cross-fade the color and normal of the details so that they take on the underlying color and normal direction of the terrain as they disappear. This prevents a sharp discontinuity with the underlying world. Click [here](Assets/TerrainDemoScene_HDRP/ShaderGraphs/TerrainGrass.shadergraph) to see the shader and understand the techniques.
