The water shader here uses the Shader Graph [Scene_Depth](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@12.1/manual/Scene-Depth-Node.html) and [Scene_Color](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@12.1/manual/Scene-Color-Node.html) nodes to create a simple animated refraction effect.  A low-resolution mask adds some noise to the edges of the water to simulate the algae and debris that accumulate near the edge of the lake.
