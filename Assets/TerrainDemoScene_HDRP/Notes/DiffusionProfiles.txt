We used the [Diffusion_Profile_Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@12.1/manual/Diffusion-Profile.html) in the Materials on the details and trees in this HDRP scene for subsurface scattering effects. Then used a [Diffusion_Profile_Override](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@12.1/manual/Override-Diffusion-Profile.html) inside a Volume for setting up the correct references. 

The *Thin* *Object* mode in the Diffusion Profile asset yields good translucent results for foliage type of objects. We recommend disabling subsurface scattering for distanced objects or lower LODs for best performance if running on device that has limited resources.
