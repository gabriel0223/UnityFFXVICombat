In this scene, we used standard Unity [Reflection_Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ReflectionProbe.html) to create the appearance of reflections on the lake surface.  

We could have used a [Planar_Reflection_Probe](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@12.1/manual/Planar-Reflection-Probe.html) , which is very good for creating accurate reflections on flat surfaces like our lake.  However, because this scene is quite large, and can be viewed from many different angles, itâ€™s easier to use conventional probes.

On high-end hardware you can enable [Screen_Space_Reflections](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@12.1/manual/Override-Screen-Space-Reflection.html) to achieve very accurate reflections.  If you want to experiment with accurate reflections, we've included a high-end HDRP asset. If you edit the  project settings to use that asset, you can enable Screen Space Reflections from the hierarchy under *Volumes* *>* *Ray* *Tracing*.
