We created the geography for this scene using an external terrain authoring package -- one of the many tools available to simulate weathering, erosion, and common landforms. 

We exported height maps and splat maps, which control the application of materials in the scene, and imported them using the Unity [Terrain_Tools](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.terrain-tools@4.0/manual/index.html) package to create a grid of terrain meshes.
